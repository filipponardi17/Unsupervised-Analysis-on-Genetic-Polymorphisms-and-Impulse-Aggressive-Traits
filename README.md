## Overview

This project, conducted by Filippo Nardi, Jorge Parre침o Hern치ndez and Riccardo Conforto Galli from the Data Science department at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, focuses on the unsupervised analysis of the relationship between various genetic polymorphisms and impulse-aggressive personality traits. The study employs a comprehensive approach, encompassing preprocessing, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, clustering, survival analysis, and genomic phenotyping using advanced machine learning techniques.

## Preprocessing

The original dataset posed challenges due to its sparsity, prompting a heatmap visualization. To enhance efficiency, feature selection was carried out, reducing the original 604 features to a more manageable subset. Key features include information related to suicidal personality types, attempt dates, gender, aggregated scores for BDHI and BIS tests, and data on genetic polymorphisms linked to suicidal ideation.

## Random Forest Feature Importances

K-Nearest Neighbor was utilized for data imputation, followed by Random Forest application to two distinct subsets emphasizing Polymorphism and BDHIS tests. Feature importances were determined using Mean Decrease Index, providing insights into the crucial variables.

## Dimensionality Reduction

Despite feature selection, high dimensionality persisted. Various techniques were explored, with Uniform Manifold Approximation Projection (UMAP) identified as the most optimal for its topology-preserving properties. BERT model coupled with PCA was employed to handle string values in polymorphism data without the need for imputation.

## GMM and K-means Clustering

Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) were employed for probabilistic clustering, optimized using Bayesian information criterion. K-means clustering on two-dimensional data provided additional insights, guided by the Silhouette score for component selection. Correlations with UMAP components were studied to understand the role of variables in each component.

## Survival Analysis

Survival analysis was conducted, incorporating K-NN algorithms for data imputation and leveraging the Cox model. These results validated hypotheses generated by the Random Forest method.

## Genomic Phenotyping using FP-Tree

The fp-tree algorithm was employed to identify support for different sets of 2 and 3 polymorphisms for distinct personality types. This allowed the determination of likely patient profiles based on genetic data, facilitating clinical analysis.
